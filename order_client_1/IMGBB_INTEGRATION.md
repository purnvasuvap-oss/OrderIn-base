# ImgBB integration removed

ImgBB integration has been removed from this project. Images are now stored in Firebase Storage and the codebase uses `src/services/storageService.js` for uploads and deletions.

If you need migration tools (e.g., to migrate legacy ImgBB-hosted images into Firebase Storage) or an admin UI for storage configuration, ask and I can implement them.
